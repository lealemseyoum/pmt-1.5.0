                        PMT Release Notes (version 1.4.2)
                                    2/25/2004

With this release, PMT now reads Exif 2.2.1 files correctly.  The ability
to remove tags without copying an image, which was mysteriously missing,
has been added.  Also, a new sample program to dump the tags from an IFD
stored in the MakerNote field.  Note that this program is dependent on 
several highly variable parameters, so your milage may vary. 

I. Bugs Fixed in this release

        * Ordering of Q-Tables.

II. New Features

        * The ability to directly remove metadata from an image.
        * 3 new metadata tags:
                * EnhancementPathUtilizied -- to help specify what has been
                  done to an image.
                * EnhancementPathVersion -- the version of the path used.
                * Gamma -- a new tag introduced in Exif 2.2.1
        * A new example program to try to read and dump IFD segments in the 
          MakerNote field.
          
          
III. Changes to Existing Features

        None.

IV. Other

        * This release has only been tested with the following open toolkits:
            * OpenExif v1.7
            * OpenTiff v1.3
            * Xerces-c v2.2 (On Linux, v2.3 and v2.4 as well)

                        PMT Release Notes (version 1.4.1)
                                   12/15/2003



I. Bugs Fixed in this release

        * Problem reading EXIF Q-Tables directly.

II. New Features

        * The SOF marker has been added to our schema and is populated by
          the EXIF accessor.
        * PMT and it's related toolkits can now be compiled new platforms:
            * 64-bit Linux
            * Mac OS X 10.3 (and should work on 10.2 machines.) 
        * A new conversion example program converts TIFF and JFIF images to 
          the EXIF 2.2 spec (or, more specifically, the Kodak PCD spec).
          
          
III. Changes to Existing Features

        * The DIG35 Accessor can now work with either MSXML or Xerces, which
          was the last holdover.  (Now the entire PMT can be used with MSXML.)
        * The DataView example program now includes tooltips if built in a 
          Motif 2.2+ environment.  These tips describe each piece of metadata 
          and give acceptable values.
        * The example.sln file has been expanded to include all examples that
          can be built in a Windows environment.


IV. Other

        * This release has only been tested with the following open toolkits:
            * OpenExif v1.6
            * OpenTiff v1.2.1
            * Xerces-c v2.2 (On Linux, v2.3 and v2.4 as well)
            
V. Known Bugs

        * None known

                        PMT Release Notes (version 1.4)
                                   11/21/2003


Most applications simply use the default schema and translation table provided
with the distribution of PMT.  If you are not reading in JPEG2000 files nor XML
metadata files, there should be no need for an XML parser.  Thus, this release
does not require one.  By using a "preparsed" default schema, the toolkit
initialization time improves by a factor of 30.

I. Bugs Fixed in this release

        * Multi-Threading support is improved.
        * All known memory leaks have been patched.
        * Various VC 7.1 support issues.
        * Various GCC 3.3.x support issues.
        
II. New Features

        * Switch of all XML parsers to be SAX2 compliant 
          (except DIG35 Accessor).
        * An XML parser is not required (can be compiled out) for limited 
          functionality.
        * Metadata items now contain documentation about what they contain
          (such as md->briefDocumentation() or md->fullDocumentation() ).
        * Thumbnail accessors have been added to the image accessors.

III. Changes to Existing Features

        * MSXML is set as the default for Windows compiles (and thus
          Xerces is no longer required).  If you are using VC 6.0, you will
          need to download the MSXML SDK from Microsoft.  VC 7.0 and 7.1 
          provide it for you.
        * A new default schema, which for the end user is almost identical 
          to the old one with a few type changes and new elements.
        * Instead of storing the trueType in a string, it is now stored as
          an enumerated type for performance and memory improvements.  The
          string can be re-created by calling md->trueType().
        * InstanceInterpreter now opens files in read/write mode by default.
        * XML output is now formatted for easy viewing.
        * PmtVersion class has been removed.
        * Updated documentation.
        * For EXIF files, ActualImageWidth and ActualImageHeight have been 
          deprecated.  Width and Height are now filled in based on the following
          formula:
          1) If Tags 40962/40963 exist, those are used;
          2) else if 256/257 exist, those are used;
          3) else use Start Of Frame information.
        * Image Accessors and metadata documentation have been added to the
          default configuration.
          

IV. Other

        * This release has only been tested with the following open toolkits:
            * OpenExif v1.5
            * OpenTiff v1.2
            * Xerces-c v2.2
            
V. Known Bugs

        * None
